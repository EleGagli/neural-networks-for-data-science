# Neural Networks for Data Science Applications (2019/2020)
## Notebooks and lab sessions

This is a repository for the lab sessions of the following course:
http://ispac.diet.uniroma1.it/scardapane/neural-networks-for-data-science-applications/

The course uses TensorFlow 2.0, moving from its core library of linear algebra up to the use of complex layers for image and audio applications.

### Lab session 1 - TensorFlow 2.0 basics & Automatic differentiation

It describes the linear algebra core of TensorFlow 2.0, before moving on to automatic differentiation with tf.GradientTape and a simple example of gradient descent.
